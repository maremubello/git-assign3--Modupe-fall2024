# Tutorial: Running Python Commands

## What I Learned

In this tutorial, I explored the basics of running Python commands using different methods. Key takeaways include:

1. **Using the Python Shell**:  
   - Start the Python shell by typing `python` or `python3` in the terminal.  
   - Execute Python commands interactively.

2. **Running Python Scripts**:  
   - Save your Python code in a `.py` file (e.g., `script.py`).  
   - Run the script using the command:  
     ```bash
     python script.py
     ```

3. **Using Jupyter Notebook**:  
   - Run Python code interactively in cells.  
   - Useful for data analysis and visualization tasks.

4. **Command-Line Arguments**:  
   - Pass arguments to scripts using the `sys.argv` module:  
     ```bash
     python script.py arg1 arg2
     ```

These foundational skills make it easier to write and execute Python code efficiently.
